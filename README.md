CMS - Contest Management System
=================================

Modified by STEP5

Introduction
------------

CMS, or Contest Management System, is a distributed system for running
and (to some extent) organizing a programming contest.

CMS has been designed to be general and to handle many different types
of contests, tasks, scorings, etc. Nonetheless, CMS has been
explicitly build to be used in the 2012 International Olympiad in
Informatics, held in September 2012 in Italy.


Support
-------

The complete CMS documentation is at <https://cms.readthedocs.org/>.

The mailing list for announcements, user support and general discussion
is <contestms@freelists.org>. You can subscribe at
<http://www.freelists.org/list/contestms>. So far, it is an extremely
low traffic mailing list.

The mailing list for development discussion (to submit feedback,
proposals and critics, get opinions and reviews, etc.) is
<contestms-dev@freelists.org>. You can subscribe at
<http://www.freelists.org/list/contestms-dev>.

To help with the troubleshooting, you can collect the complete log
files that are placed in /var/local/log/cms/ (if CMS was running
installed) or in ./log (if it was running from the local copy).
